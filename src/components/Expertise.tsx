                    <p>
                        I have built a diverse array of web applications from scratch using modern technologies such as React and Flask. 
                        Additionally, I have experience with a variety of frameworks and tools, including React Native for mobile app development, 
                        Django and Java Spring Boot for robust backend services, and Node.js and Laravel for building scalable and efficient web applications.
                        I am skilled in working with both relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB, Firebase) databases. 
                        My expertise also extends to Kotlin for Android development, and I am adept at managing the SDLC process from start to finish, 
                        ensuring seamless development for both frontend and backend components.

    <h3>DevOps & Automation</h3>
    <p>
        Once the application is built, I help clients set up DevOps testing, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment automation to ensure successful Go-Live. 
        Additionally, I have experience in designing and deploying network infrastructure, setting up secure web servers, and ensuring high availability.
        Iâ€™ve worked with Certbot to automate the provisioning of SSL certificates, ensuring secure communication for deployed applications.
        I also configure and optimize NGINX servers to host web applications, handling reverse proxying, load balancing, and setting up domain names for seamless user access.
